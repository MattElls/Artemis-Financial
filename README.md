artemis financial is a company that wnats for their software to be design safe and have no dependencies.  They specifically wanted us to make their software designed to not have any dependendcies and also to impliment hash functions.
We were able to clear out the dependencies and then impliment the suppression in the software so there were no dependencies.  
I had the hardest part of trying to get to the file to read it.
I increased security by getting rid of some of the dependencies.
After I edited the code I ran it to ensure that it woudl work.
Using a hash function and learning how to impliment one is good for future classes.
